* TODO Things to do
- Make chezmoi work on Windows

* How to install
** Windows

** Environment variables to set
On Linux the environment variable are set mainly in ~/.config/shell/login
On Windows you must set:
- XDG_CONFIG_HOME: C:\Users\USER\.config
- XDG_DATA_HOME: C:\Users\USER\.local\share
- VIMINIT: source $XDG_CONFIG_HOME\vim\vimrc

* Goals
- Similar (as mush as possible) bash, zsh, ksh and sh configuration
- Feature flag system using chezmoi's template and ignore systems
- Go fast (no loading when starting shell/splitting tmux pane)
- Avoid complex things
- Keep home directory as clean as possible

* Feature flags


* How to use this in a professional environment
A big problem of working in corporate setting is that you're not free to install just any
binary you can pull from the internet. In fact doing that usually gets you fired quick.

Using this config as is in such an environment won't work because:
- We cannot download the chezmoi binary
- We cannot download plugins (vim, emacs, tmux...)
- We cannot download scripts (base16...)

As a workaround we use Chezmoi's templating system to disable plugins, and we then export
the config to a specific directory which we can then zip and send over email to our
professional account.

: chezmoi apply --destination ~/chezmoi-pro-config

* Change theme using base16-shell
: base16 <TAB>
Choose your theme, will be saved in ~/.base16_theme and ~/.vimrc_background
